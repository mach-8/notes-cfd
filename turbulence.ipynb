    "# TURBULENCE MODELLING\n",

    "* To describe what turbulence is, it may help to start with the description of different flow regimes. Reynolds number which is a measure of the relative magnitudes of inertial and viscous forces is used to characterize flow regimes. Two critical Reynolds numbers can be defined to demarcate different flow regimes. Below the lowest critical Reynolds number (2300), flow is smooth and different layers of fluid slide past one another in an orderly manner. This regime is referred to as laminar flow. Above the lowest critical Reynolds, a series of events occur which allow transition from laminar to turbulent flow regime, with latter regime being realized above the second critical Reynolds number. The second critical Reynolds number can range from 4300 to 10000 depending on experimental conditions. Fluid flow in the turbulent regime can be described as chaotic and random. The velocity **u** in a turbulent flow can be divided into its mean value **U** and a fluctuating component **u'**.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* A turbulent flow consists of eddies of different sizes. An eddy eludes precise definition, but it can be regarded as a coherent rotational flow structure. Large eddies interact and obtain their energy from the mean flow through a process known as vortex stretching, which requires velocity gradients in the mean flow and proper alignment of the eddies. Large eddies have characteristic Reynolds numbers on the order of mean flow Reynolds numbers and are therefore dominated by inertial effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Eddies of intermediate size extract their energy from the large eddies and the small eddies feed on intermediate eddies in what is often referred to as the energy cascade. The energy of small eddies is dissipated as heat through the action of molecular viscosity. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The energy cascade was first described by Lewis F. Richardson and later quantified by Andriy Kolmogorov.\n",
    "\n",
    "* While large eddies carry majority of the energy, they tend to be anisotropic and sensitive to changes in boundary conditions. The integral length scale is the smallest length scale for a large eddy. If the Reynolds number is sufficiently high at length scales below the integral scale, the directional information is lost and eddies behave isotropically. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The spectral energy of large eddies is dependent on their characteristic velocity and length, while the energy of the small eddies is dependent on viscosity and the rate at which turbulent kinetic energy is dissipated. Intermediate eddies are too large to be affected by viscous effects, but sufficiently small so that their spectral energy is still dependent on the rate at which turbulent kinetic energy is dissipated.\n",

    "* The behaviour of wall bounded turbulent flows can be different from that of free turbulent flows (e.g., jets, wakes, etc). The presence of a solid boundary retards the flow. Away from the wall, the retarding effect slowly vanishes. A Reynolds number for such flows can be based on the length scale **L** in the flow direction. The value of this Reynolds number is on the order of $10^5$, implying that inertial effects are dominant. If we base the Reynolds number on the distance perpendicular to the flow or the distance from the wall **y**, the value of **y** would have to be on the order of **L** for inertial effects to dominate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* At sufficiently small values of **y**, especially those that result in Reynolds numbers less than 1, viscous effects tend to dominate.\n",

    "* An intermediate range of **y**'s exists where both viscous and inertial effects co-exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Based on the preceding description, it appears that there exists three distinct zones for wall bounded turbulent flows. The region closest to the wall, where viscous effects dominate, is often referred to as the viscous sublayer. The intermediate zone where both viscous and inertial effects co-exist is known as the log-law layer and the zone where inertial effects are dominant is called the outer layer.\n",
    "\n",

The root mean square values of fluctuating quantities become almost equal for a flat plate, implying that the turbulence structure becomes more isotropic as you move away from the boundary layer. On the other hand, for pipe flows, the root mean square values of turbulent properties are comparatively large in the pipe center since eddying motion transport turbulence across the centerline from regions of high production. However, experimental evidence has shown that when the second moments ($u_x^{'2}$, $u_y^{'2}$, $u_z^{'2}$, and $u'_xu'_y$) are normalized by $u_{\\tau}$, the data for flat plate and pipe flows collapse onto one another.\n",

    "\n",
    "* In attempting to model the Reynolds stresses, Boussinesq hypothesized that the viscous and turbulent stresses are analogous based on their action on the mean flow. Here, subscripts i and j have been used for x,y,z direction to make the equation more compact. A value of 1 for i or j indicates x direction. A value of 2 indicates y direction and a value of 3 indicates z direction.\n",
