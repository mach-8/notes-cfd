# CHE XXX: Computational Fluid Dynamics

## Course Description

  This course will cover fundamental aspects of computational fluid dynamics. The overall goal is to introduce students to details of the trade that are often hidden behind closed source commercial software or that may not be easy to pick from the codes of open-source software. Special emphasis will be placed on derivation of governing equations for single phase and multiphase flows, review, comparison and development of various numerical methods for the discretization of the governing equations and procedures for solving discretized governing equations.
  
## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students should be able to:
	
  1.	Analyze and choose numerical schemes for discretization of governing equations
  
  2.	Develop new numerical schemes if necessary
  
  3. 	Understand and appreciate the difficulties involved in solving discretized governing equations and how to overcome such difficulties
  
  4.    Use their knowledge of different approaches to modelling turbulence to choose turbulence models for specific applications.
  
  5.	Use Python and Jupyter Notebooks to solve simple numerical problems
